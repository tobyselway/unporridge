# UnPorridge

## About

The goal of UnPorridge is to be a browser-based 3D game engine, complete with:

 * Level editor
 * Scripting support
 * Shading
 * Animations
 * Ability to export to multiple formats (compatible with Unity, Unreal, etc.)

## Philosophy

UnPorridge is not trying to compete with the big triple-A game engines out there. Instead, its main focus is to serve as a sandbox for game developers & designers to play around with and use to test out some of their ideas in an easy-to-use and fast environment.

## For Devs

UnPorridge is a standard Laravel application with Vue.js & Tailwind CSS.
A proper guide is still to be written, but for the time being you should be able to get it up & running the same way you would with any Laravel application.

## Contributing

The project is open to contributions, however I haven't had a chance to write a contribution guide yet, or even open issues for that matter.
So feel free to reach out to me at tobyselway@outlook.com with any questions you may have, or submit a PR and we'll bounce it back and forth until we're happy with the results.
